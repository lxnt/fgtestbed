# for workshops: active/inactive
# construction_stage: 0-3
#  
# on, ready, active, powered are synonyms 
# off, needs_reload, inactive, unpowered are synonyms
#
#
# Any celdefs after an uninterrupted series of conditional and state
# tokens are emitted only for given conditions/states. 
# Effective values of tokens are OR-ed, that is a sequence of:
#
# [cond:metal]
# [state:active]
# [cond:wood]
# [state:north]
# [cel]
#  ...
# for a waterwheel building will emit the following celdef for
