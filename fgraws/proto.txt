[object:full_graphics]
#
# Terminology.
#   TILE refers to and only to logical tiles the map is composed from.
#        These are walls, floors, open space, etc.
#	 Tile names are taken from df/tiletype.h (xml/df.tile-types.xml)
#
#   CEL refers to and only to a graphical representation, be it a single
#        image or an animated sequence.
# 
#
# 'std' is the name of predefined 16x16 'font'
# anything after coordinates is considered effects
# undefined effects are ignored
#
# Tile definition token [tile:<tile name>[:<cel def]]
#   permitted tokens under it: [cel]
#   
# Cel definition token:
#   [cel:none] - do not draw anything there (open space, etc.)  
#   [cel:<blitdef>] - shortcut for [cel][blit:<blitdef]
#
#   permitted tokens under it: [blit] [blend] [color] [glow] [key]
#
#
# currently supported effect tokens:
#
# [color:<tr,ipl,et>] - classic fg,bg,br. 
#  Use either numbers, or fg,bg,br literals,
#  they stand for material's DISPLAY_COLOR values
#  see tilesets.txt for examples.
#   
# [import:path] makes sure named file is processed at this point.
# relative paths are relative to the current file
# absolute paths point to raw/objects directory.
#
# [material:class:token] applies materials of class 'class',
#  that have token 'token' in their definition to the 
#  tilesets listed below. 
#
# Material classes:
#   inorganic
#   plant
#   none : none (or, more precisely, any) material, used to define
#      material-unbound tiles.
#
# Examples:
#  [material:inorganic:SOIL] - soils
#  [material:inorganic:SEDIMENTARY]       }
#  [material:inorganic:IGNEOUS_EXTRUSIVE] } layer
#  [material:inorganic:IGNEOUS_INTRUSIVE] } stone
#  [material:inorganic:METAMORPHIC]       }
#    or
#  [material:inorganic:SEDIMENTARY|IGNEOUS_EXTRUSIVE|IGNEOUS_INTRUSIVE|METAMORPHIC]
#
#  minerals are defined like that:
#
#  [material:inorganic:IS_STONE:!SEDIMENTARY&!IGNEOUS_EXTRUSIVE&!IGNEOUS_INTRUSIVE&!METAMORPHIC]
#
#    or
#
#  [material:inorganic:ENVIRONMENT|ENVIRONMENT_SPEC|DEEP_SPECIAL|DEEP_SURFACE]
#
#   DEEP_SPECIAL selects adamantine, DEEP_SURFACE - slade
#
#
#  [material:inorganic:WOOD]
#  [material:inorganic:IS_METAL]
#  [material:inorganic:IS_GEM]
#
#  [material:plant:GRASS]
#  [material:plant:TREE]
#  [material:plant:SHRUB_TILE]
#    or
#  [material:plant:!GRASS&!TREE]
#
# Literal material name can also be used:
#  [material:inorganic:CERAMIC_PORCELAIN]
#
#  
#  Application consists mostly of taking material's 
#  DISPLAY_COLOR, processing it with any effects defined
#  for the tile and emitting the result as blit code.
#
# The following tokens are permitted under [material] one:
#  [emit:<tsname|bsname>]
#  [tile:<literal_tilename>] (as in tileset def)
#
# On the top level, [tile:tilename] explicitly defines a tile. 
# It will be drawn as defined regardless of what material 
# the game assigns to it.
#
# Buildings definition: see buildings.txt
